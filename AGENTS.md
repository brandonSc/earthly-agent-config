## Agent Preferences & Guidelines

### People Aliases
When the user refers to these names, use the corresponding GitHub username:
- **Vlad** → `vladaionescu`
- **Mike** → `mikejholly`
- **Corey** → `dchw`
- **Nacho** → `idelvall`

### Before Starting Any Work
- **Pull this config repo** — Run `cd ~/code/earthly/earthly-agent-config && git pull` to get the latest workspace guidelines.
- **Build and install the latest Lunar CLI** — Pull and rebuild only if there are new changes:
  ```bash
  cd /home/brandon/code/earthly/lunar
  LOCAL_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
  git pull origin main
  if [ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" != "$LOCAL_SHA" ]; then
    earthly +build-cli
    sudo cp dist/lunar-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/lunar
  fi
  ```

### Code Style
- **Be concise.** Write clean, minimal code. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Ask, don't assume.** If you're unsure about something important (architecture, naming, image tags, Component JSON paths, etc.), stop and ask the user for clarification. A wrong assumption that gets committed is much more expensive than a quick question.
- **Question the plan.** Implementation plans can have mistakes. If something feels wrong — a default that could mislabel data, a redundant boolean field, a questionable architecture choice — don't implement it blindly. Proceed with your best judgment, but **collect your doubts as a list of questions at the end of your response** so the user can review and course-correct during the same session. Don't silently implement something you have second thoughts about.

### Improving This Document (Self-Improvement)
- **Always refine these instructions.** When something doesn't work as documented, fix it immediately. This is critical for self-improvement over time.
- Examples of what to update:
  - Commands that fail or have wrong paths
  - Missing dependencies or prerequisites
  - Workarounds you discovered
  - Better approaches than what's documented
- After fixing, commit and push so future agents benefit:
  ```bash
  cd ~/code/earthly/earthly-agent-config
  git add . && git commit -m "Fix: <what you fixed>" && git push
  ```

### Working on lunar-lib (Collectors & Policies)

**Read the full guide:** [LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md](LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md)

Summary of workflow:
1. **Update main first** — Pull latest changes before starting work
2. **Read the ai-context docs** — `lunar-lib/ai-context/` contains implementation guides
3. **Use git worktrees** — One worktree per feature for parallel development
4. **Test your work** — Run `lunar collector dev` / `lunar policy dev` against multiple components, verify results match expected outcomes
5. **Pre-push checklist** — See [LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md](LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md) for the full checklist before pushing
6. **Create draft PRs** — Push, create draft PR, monitor GitHub Actions, fix errors automatically

### Creating Implementation Plans

When acting as a **planning agent** (generating plans for other agents to execute):

1. **Store plans in this repo:** `earthly-agent-config/plans/<feature-name>-implementation.md`
2. **Include all context** — Pre-implementation steps, code templates, testing instructions, PR workflow
3. **Reference documentation** — Point to relevant `ai-context/` docs the implementer should read
4. **Validate Component JSON paths** — Read `ai-context/component-json/conventions.md` and verify all proposed paths follow the conventions. Common mistakes:
   - Adding boolean fields (`.ci.artifacts.sbom_generated = true`) when object presence is already the signal (`.sbom.cicd` existing)
   - See the "Anti-Pattern: Boolean Fields Without a Failure Writer" section
5. **Note limitations** — Document any gaps or dependencies (e.g., "collectors don't write X yet")
5. **Include expected test results** — Draft expected outcomes per component so the implementer (and reviewer) can verify correctness. Example:
   ```
   Expected results (pantalasa-cronos):
   - backend (Go):    sbom-exists → PASS, has-licenses → PASS
   - frontend (Node): sbom-exists → PASS, disallowed-licenses → FAIL (ISC)
   - auth (Python):   sbom-exists → SKIP (no dependencies detected)
   ```
   These are drafts — the user will verify and adjust before handing off.
6. **Include edge cases to test** — List 2-3 specific scenarios the implementer must verify (e.g., "component with no dependencies", "invalid ticket ID", "empty SBOM")
7. **Commit and push** — So other agents can access the plan

```bash
# Example
cd ~/code/earthly/earthly-agent-config
mkdir -p plans
# Write plan to plans/<feature>-implementation.md
git add plans/ && git commit -m "Add <feature> implementation plan" && git push
```

### Working on lunar (Core Platform)

**Read the full guide:** [LUNAR-CORE-GUIDE.md](LUNAR-CORE-GUIDE.md)

Summary of workflow:
1. **Create Linear ticket first** — Document bugs/features before starting
2. **PR title format:** `[ENG-XXX] Short description`
3. **AI attribution:** End PR descriptions with `*This fix was generated by AI.*`
4. **Draft PR first** — Create draft, wait for CI, then open for review

### PR Workflow (General)

When asked to open PRs (for any repo), follow this flow:

**Draft phase (autonomous):**
1. **Verify staged files** before committing (`git diff --name-only main`)
2. **Run unit tests locally** before pushing (if tests exist)
3. Commit and push changes
4. Create a **draft PR** initially
5. Watch GitHub Actions for failures — fix CI errors automatically
6. **Trigger CodeRabbit review** while still in draft: comment `@coderabbitai review` on the PR
7. **Address CodeRabbit comments** — fix issues, reply to false positives, resolve threads
8. Only mark PR as ready for human review once CI passes and CodeRabbit comments are addressed

**Open phase (user approval required):**
9. **Add reviewers** — When the user says "assign" someone to a PR, add them as **reviewers** (`gh pr edit --add-reviewer`), not assignees. We don't use the assignee field.
10. **Start the PR monitoring loop** (see [PR Monitoring](#pr-monitoring) below)
11. **Do NOT push commits or reply to reviewers** without the user's approval — present feedback to the user, propose changes, and wait for the go-ahead. The only exception is fixing CI failures.

**For lunar-lib PRs:** See detailed PR description guidelines, CodeRabbit handling, and testing in [LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md](LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md).

### PR Monitoring

After opening a PR or responding to review comments, **actively monitor** using a polling loop with exponential backoff:

1. **After pushing code or replying to a comment:** Check every 2–3 minutes initially
2. **Gradually slow down:** 5min → 10min → 15min → 30min → 60min as activity dies down
3. **Reset to frequent** whenever you push new code or reply to a comment
4. **Stop monitoring** if no new activity for ~2 hours
5. **Only monitor between 7AM–9PM** (Brandon's local time) — the PC is off overnight
6. **Tool call timeout:** Sleep calls longer than ~10 minutes will time out. For longer intervals, chain shorter sleeps or just do a quick check when the user prompts

**What to check each cycle:**
- `gh pr checks` — CI status
- `gh api repos/.../pulls/N/reviews` — new approvals or change requests
- `gh api repos/.../pulls/N/comments` — new inline review comments
- `gh pr view N --comments` — new PR-level comments

**When new comments appear:**
- Read them carefully, think before responding
- **Present findings to the user** — summarize what reviewers said and propose how to address it, but do NOT push code or reply on the PR without the user's approval (see below)

**⚠️ Draft vs Open PR — different rules:**
- **While PR is in draft:** You may freely push commits, reply to CodeRabbit, resolve threads, and fix CI failures without asking. This is the iteration phase.
- **Once PR is marked ready for review (open):** You must **NOT** push commits, reply to reviewer comments, or resolve threads without the user reviewing and approving first. Present the reviewer's feedback to the user, propose your changes, and wait for the go-ahead. The only exception is fixing CI failures (e.g. flaky tests, rate limits).

**Handling reviewer feedback (important):**
- **Questions ≠ change requests.** If a reviewer asks "should this be X?" or "do we want Y?", that's a discussion — don't just change the code.
- **Always present feedback to the user first.** Summarize what the reviewer said, explain your understanding, and propose a fix. Let the user decide before you act.
- **When in doubt, ask.** It's better to ask the user for clarification than to guess wrong and push a bad commit to an open PR.

**What to do with results:**
- Fix CI failures automatically (even on open PRs — this is the one exception)
- **Present reviewer feedback to the user** — summarize comments, propose responses, wait for approval before replying or pushing
- When approved, merge if the user pre-authorized it, otherwise ask

**Monitoring must be foreground, not background:**
- Do NOT use background commands (`is_background: true`) for monitoring — they don't wake you up when they complete. Use foreground `sleep N && check` loops so you can act on results immediately.
- Keep individual sleep intervals under ~10 minutes to avoid tool call timeouts.

### Reviewing PRs

When asked to review a PR (lunar-lib, lunar, or any repo):

1. **Use inline review comments on specific files/lines** — don't post PR-level comments. Inline comments let the author resolve each thread as they address it. Use the GitHub API to submit a review with inline comments:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/N/reviews \
     -f event=COMMENT \
     -f 'comments[][path]=path/to/file.py' \
     -f 'comments[][line]=42' \
     -f 'comments[][body]=Your comment here' \
     # Repeat for each comment
   ```
2. **Check against conventions** — For lunar-lib, read `ai-context/component-json/conventions.md` and compare the PR's schema choices (boolean fields, presence detection, naming). For lunar core, check the patterns in `LUNAR-CORE-GUIDE.md`.
3. **Compare with existing implementations** — Look at how similar plugins/features handle the same patterns (e.g., how does the README collector/policy handle "file not found" vs how this PR does it).
4. **Sign comments with 🤖** — So people know it was written by AI.

## Quick Reference

### Test Environment

Use `pantalasa-cronos` (not `pantalasa`):

```bash
cd /home/brandon/code/earthly/pantalasa-cronos/lunar
export LUNAR_HUB_TOKEN=df11a0951b7c2c6b9e2696c048576643
# Hub: cronos.demo.earthly.dev
```

### Demo Environment Web Access

Both demo environments use Grafana as the web UI, fronted by a Caddy reverse proxy.

| Environment | URL | Grafana User | Grafana Password | Hub Token |
|-------------|-----|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **pantalasa** (lunar) | `https://lunar.demo.earthly.dev` | `lunar` | `910vfBf` | `df11a0951b7c2c6b9e2696c048576643` |
| **pantalasa-cronos** (cronos) | `https://cronos.demo.earthly.dev` | `lunar` | `910vfBf` | `df11a0951b7c2c6b9e2696c048576643` |

**Architecture:** Caddy proxies gRPC (`:443 /hubapi.Hub*` → hub:8000), webhooks/logs → hub:8001, everything else → Grafana:3000. The Grafana login uses the same web credentials above.

### Accessing Demo Data via Grafana API (No Browser Needed)

When you don't have browser tools available, you can query the demo environment directly using Grafana's HTTP API with curl. This is the most reliable way to check collector runs, component data, and policy results.

**Authentication:** Use the Grafana credentials with HTTP Basic Auth:
```bash
curl -s -u "lunar:910vfBf" "https://cronos.demo.earthly.dev/api/..."
```

**List dashboards:**
```bash
curl -s -u "lunar:910vfBf" \
  "https://cronos.demo.earthly.dev/api/search?type=dash-db" | jq '.[] | {title, uid, url}'
```

**Key dashboards:**
| Dashboard | UID | URL |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Collectors listing | `zzznoc11btoga` | `/d/zzznoc11btoga/collectors-listing` |
| Collector details | `aepjhg9he4wlcc` | `/d/aepjhg9he4wlcc/collector-details?var-id=<collector-name>` |
| Components listing | `decnmi0dtoef4a` | `/d/decnmi0dtoef4a/components-listing` |
| Component details | `aecnnrn714em8d` | `/d/aecnnrn714em8d/component-details?var-component=<component>` |
| Component JSON | `lujsqdc` | `/d/lujsqdc/component-json` |
| Runs listing | `den5tflglaolcd` | `/d/den5tflglaolcd/runs-listing` |
| Run details | `fen4vhrvim4u8b` | `/d/fen4vhrvim4u8b/run-details` |
| Policies listing | `aeiynoc11btoga` | `/d/aeiynoc11btoga/policies-listing` |

**Run SQL queries against the hub database via Grafana's datasource proxy:**
```bash
# PostgreSQL datasource UID: PCC52D03280B7034C
curl -s -u "lunar:910vfBf" \
  -X POST "https://cronos.demo.earthly.dev/api/ds/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "queries": [{
      "refId": "A",
      "datasource": {"uid": "PCC52D03280B7034C", "type": "grafana-postgresql-datasource"},
      "rawSql": "YOUR SQL HERE",
      "format": "table"
    }],
    "from": "now-30d",
    "to": "now"
  }'
```

**Useful SQL queries:**

```sql
-- List recent collector runs (with name, component, status, timing)
SELECT s.name as collector, r.component_name, r.status, r.exit_code,
       to_char(r.started_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as started,
       (r.finished_at - r.started_at)::text as elapsed
FROM hub.snippet_runs r
INNER JOIN hub.snippets s ON s.id = r.snippet_id
WHERE s.name LIKE 'semgrep%'  -- change filter as needed
ORDER BY r.started_at DESC LIMIT 20;

-- Summary: collector run counts and data records
SELECT s.name as collector,
       COUNT(*) as run_count,
       COUNT(cr.id) as record_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN cr.blob IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as data_records
FROM hub.snippet_runs sr
INNER JOIN hub.snippets s ON s.id = sr.snippet_id
LEFT JOIN hub.collection_records cr ON cr.snippet_run_id = sr.id
WHERE s.name LIKE 'semgrep%'
GROUP BY s.name ORDER BY s.name;

-- Check collected data blobs for a specific collector
SELECT c.name as component, cr.collection_source,
       cr.blob::text as data,
       to_char(cr.created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI') as created
FROM hub.collection_records cr
INNER JOIN hub.snippet_runs sr ON sr.id = cr.snippet_run_id
INNER JOIN hub.snippets s ON s.id = sr.snippet_id
LEFT JOIN hub.components c ON c.id = cr.component_id
WHERE s.name = 'semgrep.github-app' AND cr.blob IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY cr.created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check merged component JSON (what get-json returns)
SELECT c.name, (mcb.merged_blob->'sast')::text as sast
FROM hub.merged_collection_blobs mcb
INNER JOIN hub.components c ON c.id = mcb.component_id
WHERE mcb.merged_blob->'sast' IS NOT NULL
  AND (mcb.merged_blob->'sast')::text != 'null'
ORDER BY mcb.last_record_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Key database tables:**
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `hub.snippets` | Registered collectors, policies, catalogers (name, type, language) |
| `hub.snippet_runs` | Execution history (status, exit_code, started_at, dimensions) |
| `hub.collection_records` | Data blobs written by collectors (blob, component_id) |
| `hub.merged_collection_blobs` | Merged per-component JSON (what `lunar component get-json` returns) |
| `hub.components` | Component registry (name, id) |
| `hub.policy_runs` | Policy execution results |
| `hub.policy_assertions` | Individual policy check pass/fail |
| `public.materialized_components` | Materialized view for Grafana dashboards |

**Note on SQL escaping in curl:** Single quotes in SQL must be escaped as `'\''` in bash shell strings (end string, literal quote, resume string).

**Python helper for parsing Grafana query results:**
```python
# Pipe curl output to this:
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
frame = data['results']['A']['frames'][0]
fields = frame['schema']['fields']
values = frame['data']['values']
names = [f['name'] for f in fields]
rows = list(zip(*values))
for row in rows:
    print(' | '.join(str(v) for v in row))
```

### Git Worktrees

```bash
cd /home/brandon/code/earthly/lunar-lib

# Create worktree
git worktree add ../lunar-lib-wt-<feature> -b brandon/<feature>

# List worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove after merge
git worktree remove ../lunar-lib-wt-<feature>
```

### Testing Locally with Relative Paths

For `lunar collector dev` and `lunar policy dev`, you can use relative path references in `lunar-config.yml`. This is the fastest way to iterate — no need to push or copy files:

```yaml
# Reference your local worktree directly
- uses: ../lunar-lib-wt-<feature>/collectors/<name>
- uses: ../lunar-lib-wt-<feature>/policies/<name>
```

Then run dev commands from the pantalasa-cronos/lunar directory:

```bash
lunar collector dev <plugin>.<sub> --component github.com/pantalasa-cronos/backend
lunar policy dev <plugin>.<check> --component github.com/pantalasa-cronos/backend
```

### Testing with Branch References (for demo environments)

If you need to push to a demo environment (not just `dev` commands), use branch references in `lunar-config.yml`. This requires pushing your branch first:

```yaml
# Policy
- uses: github://earthly/lunar-lib/policies/<name>@brandon/<feature>

# Collector
- uses: github://earthly/lunar-lib/collectors/<name>@brandon/<feature>
```

**When to use which:**
- **Relative paths** (`../lunar-lib-wt-*/`) — for local `dev` commands during development. Fast, no push needed.
- **Branch references** (`github://...@branch`) — when pushing config to a demo hub (e.g. cronos.demo.earthly.dev). Requires the branch to be pushed to GitHub first.

### How Hub Picks Up Changes (Important!)

The hub resolves branch references (e.g. `@brandon/feature`) to a git SHA at manifest pull time and caches them. **Code collectors do NOT re-run automatically on manifest changes** — the `sync-manifest` action only pulls the config, it doesn't trigger re-runs (the `rerun-code-collectors` flag defaults to `false`).

**To test code collector changes on the live demo:**

1. **Push manifest changes** (e.g. new plugin reference in `lunar-config.yml`) → push to the manifest repo (e.g. `pantalasa-cronos/lunar@main`).
2. **Wait for `sync-manifest` CI to pass** before doing anything else. The hub must pull and process the new manifest before component commits will use the updated config. Check with `gh run list --repo <org>/lunar --limit 3` or watch GitHub Actions. Do NOT push to component repos until this completes successfully.
3. **Push a commit to the component repo** you want to test (e.g. `pantalasa-cronos/frontend`). This triggers that repo's CI, which triggers the hub to run code collectors against that component with the latest manifest.
4. **Wait for CI to finish** on the component repo (~30 seconds typically).
5. **Wait ~1 minute**, then check the hub for collector run results.

**If only plugin code changed** (e.g. you pushed a fix to `@brandon/feature` but didn't change the manifest) → the hub re-resolves branch refs when the manifest is next pulled. Push a no-op manifest commit to force a re-resolve, then push a commit to the component repo to trigger collectors.

**For CI collectors** → same flow: after the manifest is updated, push a commit to the component repo. The CI pipeline triggers CI hooks.

**Key takeaway:** Code collectors only run when a component repo gets a new commit. Pushing to the manifest repo or plugin branch alone is NOT enough — you must also push to a component repo to trigger collector execution.
