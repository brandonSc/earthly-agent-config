## Agent Preferences & Guidelines

### People Aliases
When the user refers to these names, use the corresponding GitHub username:
- **Vlad** → `vladaionescu`
- **Mike** → `mikejholly`

### Before Starting Any Work
- **Pull this config repo** — Run `cd ~/code/earthly/earthly-agent-config && git pull` to get the latest workspace guidelines.
- **Build and install the latest Lunar CLI** — Pull and rebuild only if there are new changes:
  ```bash
  cd /home/brandon/code/earthly/lunar
  LOCAL_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
  git pull origin main
  if [ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" != "$LOCAL_SHA" ]; then
    earthly +build-cli
    sudo cp dist/lunar-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/lunar
  fi
  ```

### Code Style
- **Be concise.** Write clean, minimal code. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Ask, don't assume.** If you're unsure about something important (architecture, naming, image tags, Component JSON paths, etc.), stop and ask the user for clarification. A wrong assumption that gets committed is much more expensive than a quick question.

### Improving This Document (Self-Improvement)
- **Always refine these instructions.** When something doesn't work as documented, fix it immediately. This is critical for self-improvement over time.
- Examples of what to update:
  - Commands that fail or have wrong paths
  - Missing dependencies or prerequisites
  - Workarounds you discovered
  - Better approaches than what's documented
- After fixing, commit and push so future agents benefit:
  ```bash
  cd ~/code/earthly/earthly-agent-config
  git add . && git commit -m "Fix: <what you fixed>" && git push
  ```

### Working on lunar-lib (Collectors & Policies)

**Read the full guide:** [LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md](LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md)

Summary of workflow:
1. **Update main first** — Pull latest changes before starting work
2. **Read the ai-context docs** — `lunar-lib/ai-context/` contains implementation guides
3. **Use git worktrees** — One worktree per feature for parallel development
4. **Test your work** — Run `lunar collector dev` / `lunar policy dev` against multiple components, verify results match expected outcomes
5. **Pre-push checklist** — See [LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md](LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md) for the full checklist before pushing
6. **Create draft PRs** — Push, create draft PR, monitor GitHub Actions, fix errors automatically

### Creating Implementation Plans

When acting as a **planning agent** (generating plans for other agents to execute):

1. **Store plans in this repo:** `earthly-agent-config/plans/<feature-name>-implementation.md`
2. **Include all context** — Pre-implementation steps, code templates, testing instructions, PR workflow
3. **Reference documentation** — Point to relevant `ai-context/` docs the implementer should read
4. **Validate Component JSON paths** — Read `ai-context/component-json/conventions.md` and verify all proposed paths follow the conventions. Common mistakes:
   - Adding boolean fields (`.ci.artifacts.sbom_generated = true`) when object presence is already the signal (`.sbom.cicd` existing)
   - See the "Anti-Pattern: Boolean Fields Without a Failure Writer" section
5. **Note limitations** — Document any gaps or dependencies (e.g., "collectors don't write X yet")
5. **Include expected test results** — Draft expected outcomes per component so the implementer (and reviewer) can verify correctness. Example:
   ```
   Expected results (pantalasa-cronos):
   - backend (Go):    sbom-exists → PASS, has-licenses → PASS
   - frontend (Node): sbom-exists → PASS, disallowed-licenses → FAIL (ISC)
   - auth (Python):   sbom-exists → SKIP (no dependencies detected)
   ```
   These are drafts — the user will verify and adjust before handing off.
6. **Include edge cases to test** — List 2-3 specific scenarios the implementer must verify (e.g., "component with no dependencies", "invalid ticket ID", "empty SBOM")
7. **Commit and push** — So other agents can access the plan

```bash
# Example
cd ~/code/earthly/earthly-agent-config
mkdir -p plans
# Write plan to plans/<feature>-implementation.md
git add plans/ && git commit -m "Add <feature> implementation plan" && git push
```

### Working on lunar (Core Platform)

**Read the full guide:** [LUNAR-CORE-GUIDE.md](LUNAR-CORE-GUIDE.md)

Summary of workflow:
1. **Create Linear ticket first** — Document bugs/features before starting
2. **PR title format:** `ENG-XXX: Short description`
3. **AI attribution:** End PR descriptions with `*This fix was generated by AI.*`
4. **Draft PR first** — Create draft, wait for CI, then open for review

### PR Workflow (General)

When asked to open PRs (for any repo), follow this flow:
1. **Verify staged files** before committing (`git diff --name-only main`)
2. **Run unit tests locally** before pushing (if tests exist)
3. Commit and push changes
4. Create a **draft PR** initially
5. Watch GitHub Actions for failures
6. Fix CI errors automatically by pushing additional commits
7. **Trigger CodeRabbit review** while still in draft: comment `@coderabbitai review` on the PR
8. **Address CodeRabbit comments** — fix issues, reply to false positives, resolve threads
9. Only mark PR as ready for human review once CI passes and CodeRabbit comments are addressed

**For lunar-lib PRs:** See detailed PR description guidelines, CodeRabbit handling, and testing in [LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md](LUNAR-PLUGIN-GUIDE.md).

### Waiting for Reviewer Responses

**Cursor operates request-response** — you wake up when the user messages you, not when external events happen. There's no notification system to alert you when reviewers comment.

**What works:**
- Background scripts can take automatic actions (e.g., auto-merge on approval)
- Scripts can log events for you to check later
- User can prompt you to check PR status

**What doesn't work:**
- No way to automatically respond to reviewer comments
- No real-time alerts when reviews come in
- Background polling burns no credits while sleeping, but you won't know results until prompted

**Recommended workflow:**
1. After pushing changes, ask user if they want you to monitor or just check later
2. Don't set up elaborate background monitoring unless auto-action is needed
3. When user prompts, check PR status and respond to any new comments

## Repository Layout

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `lunar-lib/` | Main repo for open-source collectors and policies |
| `lunar-lib-wt-*/` | Git worktrees for parallel development |
| `pantalasa-cronos/` | **Primary test environment** (use this, not `pantalasa`) |

## Agent Skills

Use skills from [earthly/skills](https://github.com/earthly/skills) and [earthly/skills-internal](https://github.com/earthly/skills-internal) for detailed implementation guidance.

### Before Using Any Skill

**Always pull and reinstall skills** to ensure you have the latest documentation:

```bash
# Public skills (Lunar, Earthfiles)
cd /home/brandon/code/earthly/skills && git pull && earthly +install-skills

# Internal skills (Linear tickets)
cd /home/brandon/code/earthly/skills-internal && git pull && earthly +install-skills
```

### Available Skills

| Skill | Repo | When to Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `lunar-collector` | skills | Creating Lunar collectors |
| `lunar-policy` | skills | Creating Lunar policies |
| `lunar-sql` | skills | Querying Lunar's SQL API |
| `earthfile` | skills | Writing Earthfiles |
| `linear-tickets` | skills-internal | Creating Linear tickets |

### Reading Skill Documentation

```bash
# Public skills
cat /home/brandon/code/earthly/skills/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md

# Internal skills
cat /home/brandon/code/earthly/skills-internal/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

## Quick Reference

### Test Environment

Use `pantalasa-cronos` (not `pantalasa`):

```bash
cd /home/brandon/code/earthly/pantalasa-cronos/lunar
export LUNAR_HUB_TOKEN=df11a0951b7c2c6b9e2696c048576643
# Hub: cronos.demo.earthly.dev
```

### Git Worktrees

```bash
cd /home/brandon/code/earthly/lunar-lib

# Create worktree
git worktree add ../lunar-lib-wt-<feature> -b brandon/<feature>

# List worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove after merge
git worktree remove ../lunar-lib-wt-<feature>
```

### Testing Locally with Relative Paths

For `lunar collector dev` and `lunar policy dev`, you can use relative path references in `lunar-config.yml`. This is the fastest way to iterate — no need to push or copy files:

```yaml
# Reference your local worktree directly
- uses: ../lunar-lib-wt-<feature>/collectors/<name>
- uses: ../lunar-lib-wt-<feature>/policies/<name>
```

Then run dev commands from the pantalasa-cronos/lunar directory:

```bash
lunar collector dev <plugin>.<sub> --component github.com/pantalasa-cronos/backend
lunar policy dev <plugin>.<check> --component github.com/pantalasa-cronos/backend
```

### Testing with Branch References (for demo environments)

If you need to push to a demo environment (not just `dev` commands), use branch references in `lunar-config.yml`. This requires pushing your branch first:

```yaml
# Policy
- uses: github://earthly/lunar-lib/policies/<name>@brandon/<feature>

# Collector
- uses: github://earthly/lunar-lib/collectors/<name>@brandon/<feature>
```

**When to use which:**
- **Relative paths** (`../lunar-lib-wt-*/`) — for local `dev` commands during development. Fast, no push needed.
- **Branch references** (`github://...@branch`) — when pushing config to a demo hub (e.g. cronos.demo.earthly.dev). Requires the branch to be pushed to GitHub first.
